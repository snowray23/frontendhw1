    <h2> Past Experiences </h2>
    <h3>Gallery Social 2010-2011</h3>
    <p1>A crazy story. My first job was when i was 16. I got hired at a beautiful Russian bar called. Gallery Social.
        I worked there for over a year. Started out as a barback, trained under the cook which helped me end up being the head chef for 2 months,
        and finally worked as a bartender when the crowds were small. As i was still under age at the time. It was my first
        job and it taught me not only to work hard but also time management skills and cooking skills.
